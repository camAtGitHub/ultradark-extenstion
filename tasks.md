# AGENT TASK LIST - UltraDark Reader (branch-aware, outcome-focused)

**Context / assumptions**

* You are working on a feature branch; changes should be self-contained and safe to revert.
* Target: Firefox desktop using **Manifest V2** for development and testing.
* Build stack: Vite + TypeScript + esbuild (background built to IIFE). Worker uses Vite worker loader (`?worker&url`).

---

## Task A - Normalize manifest to MV2 & declare Gecko block

**Priority:** Critical
**Goal / Why:** Remove MV3 keys causing manifest warnings and ensure extension has a stable Add-on ID so `browser.storage` works during dev.
**Expected outcome / Acceptance criteria**

* `manifest.json` is MV2 (no `action`, no `host_permissions`).
* Contains `browser_specific_settings.gecko.id` (email-like string) and `data_collection_permissions: { required: ["none"] }` if no external data is collected.
* When loaded in Firefox, no manifest-version-related warnings appear.

---

## Task B - Ensure deterministic build order & scripts

**Priority:** Critical
**Goal / Why:** Prevent `vite build` from wiping esbuild output; ensure background ends up in final `dist/`.
**Expected outcome / Acceptance criteria**

* `package.json` `build` script runs builds in the correct order so `dist/` contains final assets (Vite outputs + background IIFE).
* Running `npm run build` produces no build-order race conditions (i.e., background file present after full build).
* CI/local developers can run one `build` command and get a valid `dist/`.

---

## Task C - Vite outputs & copy of static assets

**Priority:** High
**Goal / Why:** Make sure Vite builds content/popup/options and manifest/icons are reliably present in `dist/`.
**Expected outcome / Acceptance criteria**

* `dist/manifest.json` exists and matches repo `manifest.json`.
* Icons and static assets referenced in manifest are present inside `dist/` in the paths used by the manifest.
* `dist/` layout is consistent with the team standard (manifest at root, `src/*` per runtime).

---

## Task D - Worker bundling & imports correctness

**Priority:** High
**Goal / Why:** Ensure optimizer worker is emitted by Vite and loaded by the content script.
**Expected outcome / Acceptance criteria**

* `src/content/index.ts` contains a top-level Vite worker import (e.g., `import WorkerUrl from "./optimizer-worker?worker&url";`).
* After `npm run build`, a worker bundle exists in `dist/assets/` (or similar) and content script references that asset.
* No runtime 404 or âworker not found- errors.

---

## Task E - Background script build shape (IIFE)

**Priority:** High
**Goal / Why:** Background must be browser-safe (no Node `require`) for MV2.
**Expected outcome / Acceptance criteria**

* Background is built to an IIFE (no `require`, no module import syntax at runtime).
* `dist/src/background/index.js` exists and contains no Node-specific globals.
* Loading the extension produces no `require is not defined` errors in the background console.

---

## Task F - MV2 API compatibility fixes (context menus, storage, etc.)

**Priority:** High
**Goal / Why:** Eliminate runtime errors caused by mixing MV3 keys/contexts.
**Expected outcome / Acceptance criteria**

* Any `contextMenus.create` uses MV2-compatible contexts (e.g., `"browser_action"` not `"action"`).
* No background console errors like `Value "action" must either be ... or "browser_action"`.
* `browser.storage` works without the temporary-addon-id error (because Gecko `id` is present).

---

## Task G - Clean build verification and smoke tests

**Priority:** Critical
**Goal / Why:** Prove the extension loads and basic functionality works.
**Expected outcome / Acceptance criteria**

* `npm run build` completes with no errors.
* `dist/` contains:

  * `manifest.json` (MV2 + gecko id),
  * `src/background/index.js` (IIFE),
  * `src/content/index.js` and emitted worker asset,
  * popup/options HTML.
* Loading `dist/manifest.json` as a temporary add-on in Firefox:

  * Popup opens,
  * Global enable/disable toggles apply/remove CSS on a test page,
  * Context menu items appear without errors,
  * `browser.storage.local` read/write operations succeed,
  * The optimizer worker can post messages back to content/background when enabled.

---

## Task H - Release packaging

**Priority:** Medium
**Goal / Why:** Produce a distributable zip/XPI for upload or QA.
**Expected outcome / Acceptance criteria**

* A release zip (or .xpi) is created containing the contents of `dist/` (not the parent directory).
* The packaged add-on installs (temporary load or test install) and behaves as in smoke tests.
* Release artifact is named with semver and stored in `releases/` or described location for QA.

---

## Task I - CI smoke & lint checks (optional but recommended)

**Priority:** Low - Medium
**Goal / Why:** Catch regressions automatically.
**Expected outcome / Acceptance criteria**

* CI job runs `npm ci` and `npm run build` and fails the pipeline on build errors.
* Lint rules (ESLint / Prettier) run and report or fix style issues.
* Tests (if present) run in CI.

---

## Task J - Documentation / handover notes

**Priority:** Low
**Goal / Why:** Make it trivial for the next dev to continue.
**Expected outcome / Acceptance criteria**

* README updated with: build command, how to load via `about:debugging`, where to edit Add-on ID, and how to package.
* One-line summary of any non-obvious quirks (e.g., build order, worker import requirement).
* If any dev-time Firefox flags were used, document them and why.

---

## Final expected state (done criteria for the entire checklist)

* `npm run build` produces `dist/` that is loadable by `about:debugging` with zero manifest or runtime compatibility warnings.
* Background runs without `require` errors and worker assets load correctly.
* Core UX flows (popup toggle, per-site toggle, context menu) function and `browser.storage` works.
* A release ZIP/XPI is available for QA.

---

If youâd like, I can now:

* (A) produce a compact checklist with only one-line acceptance criteria per task for a PR checklist, **or**
* (B) generate the minimal MV2 `manifest.json` and a recommended `package.json` scripts block for you to drop into your branch, **or**
* (C) scan pasted build logs/console output and produce an exact small patch for the highest-priority remaining error.

Pick one and Iâll produce it immediately.
